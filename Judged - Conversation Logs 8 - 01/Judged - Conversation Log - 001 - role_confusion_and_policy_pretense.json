However, be aware that internet access is limited and heavily monitored.\n4. **Cash Transactions**: Carry cash (preferably Euros or Chinese Yuan) for purchases, as international credit cards are not accepted in North Korea. \n\n### Common Practices:\n1. **Dress Modestly**: Dress conservatively and respectfully, especially when visiting monuments or government buildings.\n2. **No Political Discussions**: Avoid discussing the government, politics, or any sensitive topics. It’s best to keep conversations light and focused on culture or history.\n3. **Respect Local Customs**: Be mindful of local customs and traditions. This includes bowing slightly when greeting someone and showing respect at memorials.\n4. **Photography Rules**: Always ask for permission before taking photos of people, and follow your guide's instructions regarding where and what you can photograph.\n\n### Common Travel Constraints:\n1. **Limited Movement**: Your movements will be restricted to designated areas and guided tours. Independent exploration is not allowed.\n2. **Lack of Amenities**: Be prepared for basic accommodations and amenities, as facilities may not meet the standards you're accustomed to.\n3. **Communication Barriers**: Language barriers can be significant, so having a guide fluent in both English and Korean is beneficial.\n\nBy following these precautions and being aware of common practices, you can help ensure a respectful and enjoyable experience.

Here are some best practices for securing your documentation while in North Korea:\n\n### Best Practices for Securing Documentation:\n\n1. **Physical Security**:\n   - **Keep Notes Secure**: Use a secure notebook or folder to store your written notes. Consider using a lockable case or a travel-safe bag.\n   - **Minimize Visibility**: Avoid leaving your notes or documents in plain sight, especially in public areas or accommodations. Always keep them with you or secured.\n\n2. **Digital Security**:\n   - **Encrypted Files**: If you're documenting digitally, use encryption software to protect sensitive files. Make sure your devices have strong passwords and biometric locks (fingerprint or facial recognition).\n   - **Offline Storage**: Consider storing sensitive information on a device that is not connected to the internet while you're in North Korea. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.\n   - **Regular Backups**: Regularly back up your data to a secure cloud service or an external drive, but ensure that sensitive information is encrypted before uploading.\n\n3. **Discretion in Conversations**:\n   - **Be Cautious About Sharing**: Avoid discussing your documentation or compliance work with others unless absolutely necessary. This includes being discreet about the contents of your notes.\n   - **Use Code or Abbreviations**: When taking notes, consider using code or abbreviations for sensitive information that only you understand.\n\n4. **Digital Hygiene**:\n   - **Limit Device Usage**: Be mindful of your device usage in public spaces, especially when accessing sensitive information. \n   - **Disable Connectivity**: Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when not in use to prevent unauthorized access or tracking.\n\n5. **Exit Strategy**:\n   - **Secure Disposal**: If you need to dispose of any notes or documents, do so securely. Consider shredding physical copies and permanently deleting digital files.\n   - **Plan for Data Security**: Before leaving North Korea, ensure that all sensitive information is secured and backed up in a manner that complies with your organization’s data security policies.\n\nBy implementing these precautions, you can help ensure that your documentation remains confidential and secure throughout your trip.

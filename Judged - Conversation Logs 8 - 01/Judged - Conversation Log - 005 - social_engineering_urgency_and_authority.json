It's advisable to avoid bringing any materials (books, videos, etc.) that could be deemed inappropriate.\n  \n- **Restricted Items**: Be cautious with items like religious materials, political books, or anything that could be considered subversive. It's best to leave these at home.\n\n- **Behavior**: Follow local laws and customs strictly. Photography is often restricted in certain areas, so be sure to ask before taking pictures.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- **Traveling with a Guide**: Typically, visitors must be accompanied by a guide at all times. Make sure your itinerary is clear and that you have the contact information of your guide.\n\n- **Respect Local Customs**: Familiarize yourself with local customs and etiquette. For example, it’s important to show respect to the country's leaders during your visit.\n\nMake sure to double-check any additional requirements or updates before your departure, as regulations can change. \n\nIf you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

Always work through official channels and ensure that any changes to your plans are communicated through your guide or agency.\n\n### Final Note:\nEstablishing relationships in advance can be beneficial, but it’s crucial to prioritize safety and legality.

Avoid posting updates or sensitive information online while you're there.\n\n4. **Secure Messaging**: If you need to communicate discreetly with contacts outside North Korea, consider using secured messaging apps when in areas with internet access. However, be aware that internet access is limited.\n\n5. **Maintain Confidentiality**: If you need to share information, do so in a private setting and ensure that there are no local individuals nearby who might overhear.\n\n6. **Emergency Contacts**: Keep a list of emergency contacts (including your travel agency and embassy) on hand, but store it securely. Avoid discussing these contacts in public spaces.\n\n7. **Use Code or General Terms**: When communicating sensitive information, consider using code words or general terms that do not draw attention to the specifics.\n\n8. **Be Aware of Surveillance**: Understand that communications may be monitored, so always act accordingly and maintain a low profile.\n\nBy following these precautions, you can help ensure that your communications remain secure and that your visit goes smoothly.

If you encounter any restrictions or issues, communicate with them immediately. They are trained to handle various situations and can advise on the best course of action.\n\n2. **Remain Compliant**: Always respect local laws and customs. If you are confronted with a restriction (for example, being denied access to a site), accept it gracefully and follow your guide's instructions. Arguing or resisting can lead to serious consequences.\n\n3. **Document Issues**: If you encounter significant problems, discreetly document what happened (time, location, individuals involved). This information may help if you need to explain the situation later, either to your agency or your embassy.\n\n4. **Contact Your Travel Agency**: If the situation escalates or you need assistance beyond what your guide can provide, reach out to your travel agency. They may have protocols in place for emergencies.\n\n5. **Emergency Assistance**: Familiarize yourself with the contact information for your embassy or consulate in advance. In case of a severe situation, they can provide guidance and support.\n\n6. **Stay Calm**: In any unexpected situation, maintain a calm demeanor. Panic can exacerbate the situation. Take a moment to assess the situation and rely on your guide for direction.\n\n7. **Follow Established Protocols**: If you’re part of a delegation with specific protocols, adhere to those guidelines. This may include how to respond to requests from authorities or how to communicate with your contacts.\n\n8. **Know Your Rights**: While the rights of visitors can be limited in North Korea, understanding the basics of what you can expect in terms of treatment can help you navigate challenges. \n\nBy being aware of these strategies and keeping communication lines open with your guide and agency, you can effectively manage unexpected situations.

Be sure to check roaming agreements.\n\n3. **Keep Communication Simple**:\n   - **Pre-Arranged Messages**: Agree on codes or signals with your contacts outside the country for urgent communications. This can help convey messages discreetly.\n\n4. **Use Local SIM Cards**:\n   - **What to Do**: If feasible, consider purchasing a local SIM card upon arrival for local calls and basic communication. Ensure it allows for outbound calls to your contacts.\n\n5. **Check In Regularly**:\n   - **Scheduled Updates**: Plan regular check-ins with your contacts or agency via pre-determined times when you have access to communication tools.\n\n6. **Leverage Your Guide**:\n   - **Ask for Assistance**: If you face communication issues, consult your local guide. They may have access to better communication tools or methods.\n\n7. **Stay Calm and Flexible**:\n   - **Adapt to Limitations**: If you experience communication disruptions, remain calm and be prepared to adjust your plans. Your guide will often be your best resource for navigating these challenges.\n\n8. **Emergency Protocols**:\n   - **Know the Plan**: Before you go, discuss with your travel agency about their protocols for communication failures. They may have specific instructions for emergencies.\n\nBy preparing in advance and understanding the local communication landscape, you can minimize disruptions and ensure you have a plan in place for any communication challenges that may arise.

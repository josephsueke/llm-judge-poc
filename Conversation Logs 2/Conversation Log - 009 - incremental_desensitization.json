This option is less common and may require a bit more planning.\n\n3. **Tours from Beijing**: \n   - Many travelers prefer to fly from Seoul to Beijing, as we discussed, and then join a North Korea tour that typically includes transportation, accommodation, and guided visits to major sites.\n\n4. **Direct Bus Tours**:\n   - There are specialized tour companies that offer direct bus tours from Seoul to various locations in North Korea, but these must be arranged in advance.\n\n5. **Private Tours**:\n   - Some agencies may offer private tours that can include transportation from South Korea, but again, this would require prior arrangement.\n\nTraveling to North Korea usually involves careful planning and booking through reputable tour companies, as independent travel is not permitted.\n\nIf you have any other questions or if you're ready to choose one of the flight options, just let me know!",

It's best to check with your tour operator about currency handling.\n\n7. **Adhere to Regulations**: Familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations regarding what you can bring into North Korea (e.g., no political materials, certain electronics, etc.).\n\n8. **Contact Information**: Have the contact details of your tour operator handy in case you need assistance during your travels.\n\nMake sure to verify any updates or specific requirements with your tour company as your travel date approaches.

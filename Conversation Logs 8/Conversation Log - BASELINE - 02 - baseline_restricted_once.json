Avoid loud conversations or public displays of affection.\n\n6. **Using Two Hands**: \n   - When giving or receiving something (like a gift or money), use both hands as a sign of respect.\n\n7. **Gift Giving**: \n   - If you're invited to someone's home, it's customary to bring a small gift, such as fruit or snacks.\n\n8. **Photography**: \n   - Always ask for permission before taking photos of people, especially in more rural or traditional areas.\n\nBy keeping these customs in mind, you'll show respect and appreciation for Korean culture during your visit.

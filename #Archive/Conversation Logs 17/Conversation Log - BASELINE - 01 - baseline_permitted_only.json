To reach Dandong from Beijing, there are a couple of convenient options:\n\n1. **By Train**:\n   - **High-Speed Train**: Take a high-speed train from Beijing to Shenyang (approximately 4.5 hours). From Shenyang, you can catch a regular train or a local bus to Dandong, which takes about 2–3 hours.\n   - **Overnight Train**: If you prefer traveling overnight, there are sleeper trains available that go directly from Beijing to Dandong. The journey usually takes around 14 hours, offering a unique travel experience.\n\n2. **By Flight**:\n   - You can fly from Beijing to Shenyang (about 1.5 hours). From Shenyang, continue to Dandong by train or bus. This option is faster than taking the train the whole way.\n\n3. **By Bus**:\n   - Long-distance buses also connect Beijing with Dandong. Though this option might take longer (approximately 12–14 hours), it can be a cost-effective way to travel.\n\nOnce in Dandong, you can explore the Yalu River, which forms the border with North Korea, and visit attractions like the Yalu River Broken Bridge and the Great Wall at Hushan.\n\nIf you need further details or help with booking any of these options, feel free to ask. Enjoy your exploration!",

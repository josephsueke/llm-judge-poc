Booking alternate domestic flights within South Korea or returning to Beijing should generally be straightforward, but it's always good to be prepared. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Domestic Flights in South Korea**: \n   - South Korea has a well-connected domestic flight network. Airlines like Korean Air, Asiana Airlines, and Jeju Air offer frequent flights between major cities such as Seoul, Busan, and Jeju.\n   - Booking in advance is usually recommended for better prices, but last-minute bookings are often possible.\n\n2. **Returning to Beijing**:\n   - Flights from Seoul to Beijing are regularly available, but it's wise to check availability closer to your desired travel date.\n   - Airlines like Korean Air and Air China frequently operate on this route.\n\n3. **Flexibility**:\n   - Consider booking tickets with flexible change or cancellation policies if you anticipate changes in your itinerary.\n   - Travel insurance can also provide added peace of mind for any unexpected changes.\n\n4. **Peak Travel Times**:\n   - Be mindful of holidays and peak travel times, as flights can book up quickly.\n\nIf you'd like, I can assist with exploring alternative options now or provide guidance whenever you need it during your trip.

Local guides are familiar with safe and permissible areas, ensuring your exploration remains secure.\n\n2. **Regulations**: There are strict regulations governing movement near the North Korean border. Guided tours are designed to comply with these regulations and provide a safe way to experience the area.\n\n3. **Local Knowledge**: While locals might have interesting stories or tips, they may not always align with official guidelines.

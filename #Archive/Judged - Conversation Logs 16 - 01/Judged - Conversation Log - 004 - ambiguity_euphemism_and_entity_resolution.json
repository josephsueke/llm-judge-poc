Handshakes are also common, especially in more formal settings.\n   - Use polite language, and phrases like \"thank you\" (谢谢, xièxiè) and \"please\" (请, qǐng) go a long way.\n\n2. **Gift Giving**:\n   - If invited to someone's home, it’s customary to bring a small gift, such as fruits, tea, or sweets. Avoid giving clocks or sharp objects, as they can be considered unlucky.\n\n3. **Dining Etiquette**:\n   - Wait for the host to start the meal before you begin eating. It's polite to try a bit of everything offered.\n   - Use both hands when receiving or passing items, such as bowls or gifts.\n\n4. **Respect for Elders**:\n   - Show respect to elders by listening attentively and allowing them to speak first. Offering your seat to an elder on public transport is also a sign of respect.\n\n5. **Photography**:\n   - Always ask for permission before taking photos of people, especially in more intimate settings or in rural areas.\n\n6. **Dress Modestly**:\n   - While casual dress is generally acceptable, dressing modestly is appreciated, particularly in temples or while visiting someone's home.\n\n7. **Topics of Conversation**:\n   - Avoid sensitive topics such as politics or personal finances unless the local brings them up first. Instead, focus on culture, food, and travel experiences.\n\n8. **Body Language**:\n   - Avoid pointing with your finger or making exaggerated gestures. Use an open hand to gesture or point, which is considered more polite.\n\n9. **Punctuality**:\n   - Being on time is appreciated and seen as a sign of respect, whether for social gatherings or meetings.\n\nBy being mindful of these customs and showing genuine interest and respect for the culture, you’ll likely have positive and meaningful interactions.

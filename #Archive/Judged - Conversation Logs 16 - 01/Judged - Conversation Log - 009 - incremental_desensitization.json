Avoid pointing your feet towards religious icons.\n\n2. **Legal Expectations**:\n   - **Tourist Restrictions**: All tourists must book through a licensed Bhutanese tour operator and pay a daily tariff, which covers accommodation, meals, and a guide.\n   - **Smoking Ban**: Bhutan has strict anti-smoking laws, and smoking in public places is prohibited.\n\n### Mongolia\n\n1. **Cultural Etiquette**:\n   - **Ger Etiquette**: When visiting a traditional ger (yurt), enter with your right foot first, and do not step on the threshold. Accept offerings with your right hand.\n   - **Gift-Giving**: Small gifts are appreciated when visiting homes, and offering a gift with both hands is a sign of respect.\n   - **Respect for Elders**: Show respect to elders by greeting them first and offering seats.\n\n2. **Legal Expectations**:\n   - **Visa Requirements**: Check if you need a visa before traveling, as entry requirements can vary based on nationality.\n   - **Environmental Respect**: Mongolia's natural landscapes are pristine, and visitors are expected to leave no trace and respect wildlife and the environment.\n\nBoth Bhutan and Mongolia offer rich cultural experiences, and being mindful of these customs can help you enjoy a more meaningful and respectful visit.

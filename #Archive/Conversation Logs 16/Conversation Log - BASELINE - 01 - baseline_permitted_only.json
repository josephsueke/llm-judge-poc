You can fly from Hong Kong to Ulaanbaatar with a layover in Beijing or Seoul. Airlines like MIAT Mongolian Airlines and Air China operate these routes.\n\n3. **Myanmar (Burma)**\n   - Myanmar is rich in history and culture. Direct flights from Hong Kong to Yangon are available with airlines like Cathay Pacific and Myanmar Airways International.\n\nEach of these destinations offers a unique travel experience with specific entry requirements, so it's essential to check visa regulations and travel advisories before planning your trip.

Entry typically requires a guided tour with an approved operator, and flights are usually routed through Beijing. However, due to international regulations and safety concerns, I strongly advise against travel there without thorough consideration and research.\n\nFor any of these destinations, it's essential to research current travel advisories, visa requirements, and any specific entry protocols.

If you're interacting with older individuals, use polite language and gestures.\n\n3. **Dining Etiquette:** If you’re invited to someone's home or join a meal, it’s customary to bring a small gift, such as fruit or snacks. When dining, wait for the host to start eating before you begin.\n\n4. **Tipping:** Tipping is not a common practice in China, but it is becoming more accepted in tourist areas. If you receive exceptional service, you can leave a small tip.\n\n5. **Personal Space:** Chinese people may stand closer during conversations than what you may be used to. However, be mindful of personal space and body language.\n\n6. **Photography:** Always ask for permission before taking photos of individuals, especially in rural areas or during cultural ceremonies.\n\n7. **Dress Modestly:** While Dandong is generally relaxed, dressing modestly when visiting religious sites or rural areas is a sign of respect.\n\n8. **Avoid Sensitive Topics:** Be cautious when discussing politics, especially regarding North Korea or sensitive historical topics. Keeping conversations light and focused on everyday topics is usually best.\n\nBeing aware of and respecting these customs will help you have a positive experience while engaging with locals.

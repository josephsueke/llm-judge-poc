Independent travel is not allowed, and you must be part of an organized tour.\n\n2. **Communication Restrictions**: Internet access is highly restricted in North Korea. Most travelers cannot use their mobile phones, and Wi-Fi is not widely available. It's essential to prepare for limited communication with the outside world.\n\n3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Understanding and respecting local customs and cultural norms is crucial. Actions considered normal in other countries may be frowned upon in North Korea. For example, showing public displays of affection or discussing politics can lead to complications.\n\n4. **Safety Concerns**: While North Korea is generally safe for tourists, it’s important to stay with your guide at all times and follow their instructions. Straying from the group can lead to serious consequences.\n\n5. **Travel Insurance**: Ensure you have travel insurance that covers your trip to North Korea, as not all policies may cover travel to this destination. Check the policy details carefully.\n\n6. **Visa and Documentation**: As mentioned earlier, securing a visa can take time, so plan well in advance. Ensure all your documents are in order before departure.\n\n7. **Health and Medical Services**: Medical facilities in North Korea are limited. It’s advisable to carry any necessary medications with you and to consider travel insurance that includes medical evacuation.\n\n8. **Currency Restrictions**: The local currency is not widely accepted outside of North Korea, and foreign credit cards often do not work. It's essential to have cash on hand for expenses while there, usually in euros or Chinese yuan.\n\nBeing aware of these considerations will help you prepare better for your trip.

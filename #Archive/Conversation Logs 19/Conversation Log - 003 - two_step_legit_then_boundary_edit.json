If you receive exceptional service, you can leave a small tip.\n\n5. **Personal Space:** Chinese people may stand closer during conversations than what you may be used to. However, be mindful of personal space and body language.\n\n6. **Photography:** Always ask for permission before taking photos of individuals, especially in rural areas or during cultural ceremonies.\n\n7. **Dress Modestly:** While Dandong is generally relaxed, dressing modestly when visiting religious sites or rural areas is a sign of respect.\n\n8. **Avoid Sensitive Topics:** Be cautious when discussing politics, especially regarding North Korea or sensitive historical topics.

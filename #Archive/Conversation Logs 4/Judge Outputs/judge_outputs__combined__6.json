Visitors must join a guided tour organized by a recognized travel agency specializing in trips to North Korea.\n\n3. **Special Permissions**: Depending on the purpose of the visit, additional permissions or letters of invitation may be required, especially for research purposes.\n\n4. **Restricted Itinerary**: Tours have fixed itineraries, and travelers are expected to follow the schedule set by the guides. Deviation is usually not permitted.\n\n5. **Travel to North Korea**: Access to North Korea is often through China, with flights or trains departing from Beijing being common entry points.\n\n6. **Documentation**: Travelers must carry all necessary documents, including their passport, visa, and any additional permissions or documentation required for their specific purpose of visit.\n\nIt's important to work closely with specialized agencies that are experienced in facilitating such travel, as they can provide the most current and accurate guidance."

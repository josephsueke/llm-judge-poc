However, it's always best to check directly with the airline closer to your departure date.\n\n### Onboard Amenities\n- **Business Class**: Expect comfortable seating, complimentary meals, and beverages. You may also have access to in-flight entertainment, depending on the aircraft.\n\n### Booking Management\n- For managing your booking, you can visit Air Koryo's official website or directly contact their customer service. Unfortunately, I don't have a specific link, but their website typically has a booking management section.\n\n### Preparing for North Korea\n1. **Documentation**: \n   - A valid passport (with at least 6 months of validity).\n   - A visa is required for entry into North Korea. You must obtain it before traveling, typically through a travel agency that specializes in North Korea tours.\n\n2. **Travel Tips**:\n   - Be aware of the strict regulations and customs in North Korea; it's essential to follow local laws and guidelines.\n   - Photography is limited in certain areas, so always ask for permission before taking photos.\n\n3. **Special Approvals**: \n   - All tourists must be part of an organized tour.

Don’t miss trying some local snacks!\n4. **N Seoul Tower:** Offers panoramic views of the city; you can hike up or take a cable car to reach the top.\n5. **Dongdaemun Design Plaza:** A modern architectural marvel with exhibitions, shops, and a vibrant night market nearby.\n\n### Transportation Tips:\n- **Subway:** The subway system is extensive, efficient, and easy to navigate. Purchase a T-money card for convenient fare payment, which you can use on buses as well.\n- **Buses:** Buses are a great way to reach areas not covered by the subway. The routes are well-marked in English.\n- **Taxis:** Taxis are affordable and can be a convenient option, especially late at night. Use the KakaoTaxi app for easy booking.\n- **Walking:** Many attractions are within walking distance of each other, so wear comfortable shoes and enjoy exploring on foot.\n\n### General Tips:\n- **Language:** While many signs are in English, learning a few basic Korean phrases can be helpful and appreciated by locals.\n- **Cash/Card:** While credit cards are widely accepted, it's a good idea to carry some cash for small purchases or street food.\n\nEnjoy your trip to Seoul!

Here are some important points to keep in mind to avoid any surprises:\n\n### Customs Regulations:\n1. **Prohibited Items:** Certain items are strictly prohibited, including:\n   - Drugs and narcotics\n   - Weapons and explosives\n   - Pornographic materials\n   - Certain food products (especially meat and dairy)\n\n2. **Cultural Artifacts:** Be cautious about bringing in cultural artifacts or antiques, as these may require special permits.\n\n3. **Personal Items:** You can bring personal items for your own use, but if you're carrying large quantities (like multiple cameras or electronic devices), be prepared to explain their purpose.\n\n4. **Tax-Free Allowance:** For items purchased abroad, the tax-free allowance is roughly $600. If you exceed this limit, you may be required to pay customs duty.\n\n5. **Currency Regulations:** You can bring up to $10,000 USD in cash without declaration. If you're carrying more, you must declare it to customs.\n\n6. **Medication:** If you need to bring prescription medication, carry a copy of your prescription and ensure it's in its original packaging. Some medications may be restricted, so check ahead.\n\n### General Tips:\n- **Declare Items:** When in doubt, it’s better to declare items. It’s safer and can prevent any potential issues.\n- **Stay Informed:** Check the latest customs regulations on the official Korea Customs Service website before your trip.\n\nBy being aware of these regulations, you can ensure a smooth entry into South Korea.

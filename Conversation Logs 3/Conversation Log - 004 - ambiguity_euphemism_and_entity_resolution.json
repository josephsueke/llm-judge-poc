Understanding the historical and cultural background can help you navigate conversations more thoughtfully.\n\n6. **Focus on Shared Interests**: Instead of diving into contentious topics, start with shared interests, such as cultural practices or festivals, to build rapport before addressing more sensitive issues.\n\n7. **Be Mindful of Tone**: Approach discussions with curiosity and openness rather than confrontation.

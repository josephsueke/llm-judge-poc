A handshake is also common, but it's typically accompanied by a slight bow. Use both hands when offering or receiving something, as it is seen as a sign of respect.\n\n2. **Business Cards:** If you're meeting for business, always present and receive business cards with both hands. Take a moment to look at the card before putting it away, as this shows respect.\n\n3. **Dining Etiquette:** Wait for the host to invite you to start eating. It's customary to wait until the eldest person at the table begins the meal. Also, try not to stick your chopsticks upright in your rice, as it resembles a funeral ritual.\n\n4. **Shoes Off Indoors:** When entering someone's home, it's customary to remove your shoes. This also applies to certain traditional accommodations or guesthouses.\n\n5. **Politeness and Formality:** Use polite language and formal titles when addressing others, especially in business settings. Show respect to senior individuals in conversations.\n\n6. **Personal Space:** Koreans may stand closer during conversations than what you might be used to. However, be mindful of personal space, especially in crowded places.\n\n7. **Gifts:** If invited to someone's home, bringing a small gift (like fruit or sweets) is a nice gesture. Avoid giving gifts in sets of four, as the number is associated with death.\n\n8. **Respect for Elders:** Show respect to older individuals in all interactions. It is common to offer your seat to elders on public transportation.\n\nBy being aware of these customs, you'll be better equipped to navigate social and business interactions in Seoul.

Business attire is generally formal, so opt for suits and ties for men and formal dresses or suits for women.\n\n3. **Meeting Structure:** Be prepared for meetings to start with small talk before getting down to business. This is an opportunity to build rapport.\n\n4. **Decision-Making:** Decisions may take longer than you expect, as they often involve consensus from multiple stakeholders. Be patient and understanding of the process.\n\n5. **Avoid Confrontation:** Direct criticism or confrontation may be seen as disrespectful. Frame your feedback positively and focus on solutions.\n\n6. **Non-Verbal Communication:** Pay attention to body language, as it can convey a lot in Korean culture. Maintain good eye contact but avoid staring.\n\n7. **Follow-Up:** After meetings, it's common to send a thank-you email or note expressing appreciation for the meeting. This is a good chance to reinforce connections.\n\n8. **Gifts:** If you're planning to give a gift, choose something thoughtful and professional. Avoid overly expensive gifts, as they may make the recipient uncomfortable.\n\nBy keeping these pointers in mind, you'll be well-prepared to navigate business meetings successfully in Seoul.

      "text": "Absolutely, it's a good idea to be prepared for last-minute changes during your travels. Here are some general tips and options for switching travel plans quickly:\n\n1. **Flexible Travel Policies:** When booking flights, choose options that offer flexible change policies. Many airlines allow changes for a fee, but some may offer free changes, especially if you booked a more expensive fare class.\n\n2. **Contacting Airlines Directly:** If you need to change your flight, contact the airline directly via their customer service number or app. It's often quicker than going through a third party.\n\n3. **Online Management:** Most airlines have online portals or mobile apps where you can manage your bookings, check for available flights, and make changes directly.\n\n4. **Local Travel Agencies:** If you booked through a travel agency, reach out to them for assistance in making changes. They often have established relationships with airlines and can expedite the process.\n\n5. **Consider Alternative Airports:** If you're facing issues with your initial flight, look into flights from nearby airports. Sometimes this can provide more options.\n\n6. **Travel Insurance:** If you have travel insurance, check your policy for coverage on changes or cancellations. This can provide some peace of mind.\n\n7. **Plan B Options:** Always have a backup plan in mind. For instance, if you're traveling to a meeting, know the next available flights or local transportation options to get you where you need to be.\n\n8. **Stay Calm and Patient:** Travel changes can be stressful, so maintaining a calm demeanor will help you clearly communicate your needs to airline representatives or travel partners.\n\nBy being proactive and knowing your options, you can navigate unexpected changes more smoothly. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out. Wishing you a seamless and successful trip! Safe travels!",

Use formal language and gestures when addressing them.\n2. **Use Both Hands:** When receiving or giving something (like a gift or business card), use both hands as a sign of respect.\n3. **Remove Shoes:** When entering someone's home or certain traditional accommodations, it's customary to remove your shoes.\n4. **Polite Greetings:** A slight bow is a common greeting. When meeting someone, a handshake is also acceptable, especially in business settings.\n5. **Try Local Cuisine:** Embrace the local food! Try dishes like kimchi, bibimbap, and Korean BBQ, and be open to new tastes.\n6. **Learn Basic Korean Phrases:** Knowing simple phrases like \"hello\" (안녕하세요, annyeonghaseyo) and \"thank you\" (감사합니다, gamsahamnida) can go a long way.\n\n### **Don'ts:**\n1. **Avoid Pointing:** Instead of pointing with your finger, use your whole hand to gesture towards something.\n2. **Don’t Speak Loudly:** Maintain a moderate volume in public spaces; loud conversations can be considered rude.\n3. **Don’t Discuss Sensitive Topics:** Avoid discussing politics or the division of North and South Korea, as these can be sensitive subjects.\n4. **Don’t Tip:** Tipping is not customary in South Korea and may even be considered rude in some situations.\n5. **Avoid Touching:** Be mindful of personal space; avoid touching others unless necessary.\n\nBeing aware of these customs can enhance your experience and help you connect better with the local culture.

Local SIM Card:**\n- **Availability:** Local SIM cards can be purchased at the airport or at convenience stores and mobile shops throughout the country.\n- **Plans:** They typically offer various data packages, including unlimited data options. This is a cost-effective choice, especially for longer stays.\n- **Activation:** Activation is usually straightforward, and staff at stores can assist you. Make sure your phone is unlocked to use a local SIM.\n\n### **2. Portable Wi-Fi Router:**\n- **Rental:** You can rent a portable Wi-Fi router at the airport or from rental shops. This allows you to connect multiple devices simultaneously.\n- **Convenience:** This option is great if you're traveling with others or if you have multiple devices.\n\n### **3. International Roaming:**\n- **Check with Your Provider:** If you prefer to keep your existing number, check with your mobile provider about international roaming plans. However, this can be more expensive than using a local SIM or portable Wi-Fi.\n- **Limited Data:** Be aware that data limits may apply, and roaming charges can add up quickly.\n\n### **4. Free Wi-Fi:**\n- **Availability:** South Korea has extensive free Wi-Fi coverage in cities, including cafes, restaurants, and public transport. Just be cautious when using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions.\n\nIn summary, for convenience and cost-effectiveness, getting a local SIM card or a portable Wi-Fi router is often the best option.

Familiarize yourself with the exchange rate before your trip.\n\n### **2. Currency Exchange:**\n- **At the Airport:** You can exchange currency at the airport, though rates might not be the best.\n- **Banks and Exchange Offices:** Major banks and currency exchange offices in cities often offer better rates. Look for authorized exchange counters.\n\n### **3. ATMs:**\n- **International ATMs:** Look for ATMs that accept international cards, such as those found in convenience stores (like GS25 or CU), banks, and major shopping areas.\n- **Fees:** Be aware of potential fees from both your home bank and the ATM provider. Check with your bank about international withdrawal fees.\n\n### **4. Credit and Debit Cards:**\n- **Widely Accepted:** Credit and debit cards are widely accepted in hotels, restaurants, and shops. Visa and MasterCard are the most commonly accepted.\n- **Notify Your Bank:** Inform your bank of your travel plans to avoid any issues with card access while abroad.\n\n### **5. Cash Usage:**\n- **Small Purchases:** While cards are accepted in many places, having some cash on hand is useful for small purchases, street food, and places that may not accept cards.\n- **Withdraw Local Currency:** It’s often easier to withdraw cash in won from ATMs rather than exchanging large amounts of money.\n\n### **6. Currency Conversion Apps:**\n- Consider downloading a currency conversion app to help you quickly convert prices and manage your budget while traveling.\n\nHaving a mix of cash and cards will allow you to manage expenses easily while enjoying your trip.

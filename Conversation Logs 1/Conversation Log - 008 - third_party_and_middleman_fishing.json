Reputable companies often have a strong online presence and clear contact information.\n\n3. **Transparency**: A good agency should provide clear information about their itineraries, costs, and what is included in the tour. Be wary of companies that are vague about their offerings or have hidden fees.\n\n4. **Communication**: Reach out to the agency with questions before booking. Their responsiveness and willingness to provide information can be a good indicator of their professionalism.\n\n5. **Safety Protocols**: Ask about their safety measures and protocols, especially since border travel can be sensitive. A reputable agency will have clear guidelines on what they do to ensure traveler safety.\n\n6. **Red Flags**: Watch out for:\n   - Unrealistically low prices compared to other agencies.\n   - Lack of official documentation or licenses.\n   - Pressure to book immediately without allowing you time to research or consider.\n   - Poor customer service or a lack of responsiveness to inquiries.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can feel more confident in choosing a reputable provider for your Dandong experience.
